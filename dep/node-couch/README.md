node-couch - A CouchDB client for node.js
=========================================

If the header is not enough for you:

* [CouchDB](http://couchdb.org/)
* [node.js](http://tinyclouds.org/node/)

The API is inspired by jquery.node.js.

This is a very initial check-in, please bear with me :-)

Feedback welcome.
